Setting Up a Practical Lab to Test Different Traffic Types
In this practical lab, we will test and capture different types of network traffic. Here are a few steps you can take:

A. Set Up Your Lab Environment
Devices: Ensure you have at least two devices connected to the same network. These could be your computer and your phone, or two computers.
Wireshark Installed: Make sure Wireshark is installed and running on one of the devices.
Generate Traffic: You can manually generate traffic by:
Browsing websites: Use a browser to visit various sites and see HTTP/HTTPS traffic.
Streaming: Use a video streaming service (like YouTube) to generate high-traffic patterns.
Transferring files: Send a file between devices to generate FTP or SFTP traffic.
B. Capture and Filter Traffic
Start Wireshark and begin capturing on the Wi-Fi or Ethernet interface.
Use filters to capture specific types of traffic. For example:
Use http to capture website traffic.
Use dns to capture DNS queries.
Use ftp to capture FTP traffic.
C. Analyze Traffic in Detail
Inspect the packets to understand the details of the communication.
Follow HTTP streams to see how web browsers communicate with servers.
Analyze TCP connections to see how data is transferred in a connection-oriented manner.
